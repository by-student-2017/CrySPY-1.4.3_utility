# CrySPY-1.4.3_utility
- This is unofficial, but it has more examples than the original. I added them after confirming that it works.
- This is a calculation example. For practical use, it is recommended to increase the number of nat and tot_struc.
- LAQA: only VASP, QE, or soiap for now
- The "element_data_*.txt" series was not created with complete accuracy due to time and computational constraints. Therefore, please modify it yourself as needed. I lack the research environment to properly organize this data; Japan is simply inadequate in this regard.

## Results and random numbers
- The random seed is changed so the results will not match those in the data. Therefore, even if the environment is almost the same and the user is the same, the results will be different.

## Calculated phase diagram
- The "end_point" is a parameter that specifies the search range of the chemical potential. The standard is to obtain the DFT energy of a single molecule from databases such as Material Projects, literature, or your own calculations, and expand it by about +/- 1 eV.
- The element_structure file in the example is not actually necessary for EA-vc. It is output for reference. Therefore, the make_input_*.py shown below can be made simpler. Since simpler is often better, users may wish to simplify it themselves.
- The general rule for state diagrams is to arrange them in alphabetical order. General names may not always be arranged in alphabetical order. Just be aware of the general rule.
- Temperature control is performed using molecular dynamics (MD). The effects of lattice vibrations (phonons) are taken into account, but the calculation takes time.
- For pressure application at 0 K, it is also a good idea to use QE or the old DFTB+. It is also a good method to find candidates from there and examine them in more detail using MD etc.
- When applying temperature and pressure, the diagram will only be accurate if the energy and end_point values in element_data_*.txt are adjusted to reflect the crystal structure at those conditions. If your goal is simply to highlight differences in stable structures, you can make the diagram easier to read by setting these values to zero or to a slightly positive number.

## How to use "plot3d.py", "plot3dn.py", "pplot_v1.py", or "plot1d.py"
- It is designed to correspond to a four-element system. The figure can be obtained by the following command.
```
python3 plot3d.py
```
```
python3 plot3dn.py
```
- The number of atoms of one element in the quaternary system is fixed (nat is fixed to a certain value) and the calculation is performed as a pseudo-ternary system, and the results are shown in the figures. The name "v1" is used because the guide lines have not yet been drawn properly. ("PTD" is an abbreviation for pseudo-ternary diagram.)
```
python3 pplot_v1.py
```
- Use "cryspy_rslt" obtained in any calculation to plot a diagram of Structure ID vs. Energy (eV/atom).
```
python3 plot1d.py
```
- Instead of plot1d.py, a gnuplot version is also available. The usage is as follows (-persist can be omitted):
```
gnuplot -persist plot1d.gpl
```
- Gnuplot can also be used to create ternary and quaternary phase diagrams, but changing the axis angles is extremely tedious, so it is not provided here. (Readers with ample time might want to try making them, although researchers with such time are probably a rare breed these days.)

## Automatic generation of input files (EA-vc + CHGNet version)
- Since creating an input file manually can be cumbersome, a Python script called make_input.py is provided for CHGNet (see ase_chgnet_auto_EA-vc).
```
python3 make_input.py Al C Ni Fe
```
- Specify the elements after make_input.py. You can also create ternary or quinary systems.
- The file element_data_chgnet.txt is critical because it is used by ASE to generate POSCAR files.
- This file contains reference structures and lattice constants, which may include simplified or metastable phases for convenience (e.g., Boron as a diamond structure).
- These values are intended for efficient initial structure generation and may differ from actual ground-state phases.
- For accurate results, it is strongly recommended to re-optimize the final structures and energies using DFT or other first-principles methods.
- If necessary, you can edit element_data_chgnet.txt to replace entries with known stable phases or literature values.
- If the generated results appear incorrect, check and adjust this file accordingly.
- If you want to use B_aB12, just change B_dia to a directory named B_aB12, change POSCAR to correspond to the structure of aB12, and change the end_point in cryspy to the eV/atom of aB12. These can be done after "make_input.py". 

## Automatic generation of input files (EA-vc + DFTB+(GFN1-xTB) version)
- The "element_data_dftb.txt" has not been rewritten with the GFN1-xTB results in DFTB+ (I plan to fix this in the future if I have time). Therefore, an element_structure file will be created, so please calculate it and correct the end_point.
- GFN2-xTB can also be specified in dftb_in.hsd, but GFN2-xTB is difficult to handle due to its computational cost and convergence. In the paper, good results were obtained with GFN1-xTB for MOF, so here we create an example using GFN1-xTB.
- Interested readers may want to try using GFN2-xTB or the skf file, etc.

## Automatic generation of input files (EA-vc + QE version)
- The "element_data_qe.txt" does not reflect the results of QE (we plan to fix this in the future if we have time). Therefore, the element_structure file will be created, so please perform the calculation and correct the end_point (element_structure may also not be created correctly, so please check).
- QE and VASP can also be discussed in terms of enthalpy by entering only pressure. Please refer to the official manual.

## Automatic generation of input files (EA-vc + Lammps version)
- The Lammps results are not reflected in "element_data_lammps.txt" (we plan to fix this in the future if we have time). Therefore, the element_structure file will be created, so please run the calculation and correct the end_point (the element_structure may not have been created correctly, so please check).
- The Lammps EAM potential code has been rewritten to fully match the Zhou 2004 data published by NIST, and parameters for previously reported elements have been added. It is theoretically more expressive than Lennard-Jones (LJ), so it may be worth considering using it. However, not all elements are included.

## Automatic generation of input files (EA-vc + MACE version)
- The MACE results are not reflected in "element_data_mace.txt" (I plan to fix this in the future if I have time). Therefore, the element_structure file will be created, so please run the calculation and correct the end_point (it's possible that the element_structure was not created correctly, so please check). As with CHGNet, I think it's fine to match it to the VASP results. It's also a good idea to organize it with Material Projects data.

## Enthalpy (pv_term) (such as in high-pressure research)
- Examples of input files are located in the directory labeled "pv_term".
- Currently (24/Oct/2025), only QE and VASP are supported. QE does not yet support reading enthalpy using the energy_step_flag option. (1 [kbar] = 0.1 [GPa])

## Random Search (RS)
- Even after a series of calculations has finished, you can continue the calculations by increasing the value of tot_struc in cryspy.in.
- This is an important method if you want to find the most stable phase rather than a phase diagram.

## How to use "repeat_cryspy.sh"
- "repeat_cryspy.sh" can be used anywhere. You can copy it and use it instead of cryspy as follows.
```
chmod +x repeat_cryspy.sh
bash repeat_cryspy.sh
```

## Linking different calculation codes
- We built a system that allows calculations to continue using different calculation codes by utilizing "load_struc_flag=True".
- I'm using Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) because I don't have a VASP license or the budget for a high-performance computer.
Since CHGNet and MACE utilize VASP data, calculations don't proceed as smoothly with QE (whereas structural optimization would likely be much faster with VASP).
- I think that by improving "ase_chgnet_qe_auto_EA-vc", it would be relatively easy to create combinations with other calculation codes, so I hope users will do their best with VASP on their own.

## Useful features
- Deleting old files: "cryspy -c" or "cryspy --clean"
- Enthalpy: "pv_term = True" and "press = 400". see "qe_Sr4O4_RS_pv_term"
- Replot: "cryspy-Eplot" or "cryspy-calc-convex-hull 1"
- Jupyter Notebook: https://tomoki-yamashita.github.io/CrySPY_doc/tutorial/interactive/index.html

## The "kppvol" and actual k-points
- The "kppvol" is k-points/volume [A^-3].
- The actual k-points to be set can be determined using "kpt_check.py".
- A kppovl value of 40 is appropriate for rough calculations, while a value of 80 is appropriate for full calculations, so no special changes are necessary.

## kppvol (k-points per volume) Standards and Accuracy Guidelines
- Energy convergence depends on the system size and band structure, but as a rule of thumb:
- kppvol = 30–50: Accuracy of a few meV/atom in solids
- kppvol = 60–80: Often aiming for 1 meV/atom or less
- (kppvol = 25: 5-10 meV/atom, kppvol = 35: 2-5 meV/atom, kppvol = 40: 2-4 meV/atom)
### In metallic systems, introducing smearing (Methfessel-Paxton, Gaussian, etc.) reduces the energy oscillations caused by discontinuities in the Fermi surface, making it easier to maintain accuracy even with a somewhat coarse k-point mesh.
- Metals with smearing: kppvol 35–45, approximately a few meV/atom
- High accuracy (phase transitions and small energy differences): kppvol ≥ 60 recommended
- kppvol = 35 is somewhat coarse, and typically results in an error of 2–5 meV/atom.
### Changing the calculation conditions for the purpose of exploration
- For magnetic systems, the energy difference is very small (often less than a few meV/atom), so the accuracy requirements are high. Especially when comparing magnetic order (FM vs AFM) or the stability of spin structures, an error of 1 meV/atom level can have a significant impact on the results. However, the accuracy requirements vary depending on your application in CrySPY:
- Initial structure search (EA or random search): A rough search is OK. kppvol = 30–40 is sufficient. Since the goal is candidate generation, some error is acceptable.
- Final evaluation (determination of magnetic order and relative stability): High accuracy is required. kppvol >= 60 is recommended. Magnetic systems have complex band structures, and smearing has limited effectiveness, so a dense k-point is required.

## Phase Diagrams Attracting Attention

Phase diagrams are essential for understanding phase stability and material properties. The following points highlight current challenges and recommendations:

- **International Collaboration:**  
  Phase diagrams for precious metals, rare earths, and other elements that are difficult to obtain experimentally should ideally be compiled at multiple computational levels (e.g., CALPHAD, first-principles) through cooperation between countries.

- **Organization Rule:**  
  The general convention for arranging phase diagrams is alphabetical order. While common names may occasionally deviate, awareness of this rule ensures consistency.

- **Current Status and Future Needs:**  
  Phase diagrams are being collected by organizations such as **NIMS**, but the available information is incomplete. It would be highly beneficial to compile these datasets using integrated platforms such as **Phase0** or similar frameworks to enable collaborative development and global accessibility.

- **Next Research Stage:**  
  Once phase diagrams are clarified, researchers can advance to the next stage: performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in composition regions of interest. These simulations enable the study of dislocation behavior, mechanical properties, and environmental effects, providing deeper insights into material performance under realistic conditions.  
  **Note:** CrySPY focuses on crystal structure prediction. For MD and related property evaluations, tools such as **ASE**, **LAMMPS**, **Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)**, **VASP**, **Siesta**, **CP2K**, and **OpenMX** should be utilized.
