# CrySPY-1.4.3_utility
- This is unofficial, but it has more examples than the original. I added them after confirming that it works.
- This is a calculation example. For practical use, it is recommended to increase the number of nat and tot_struc.
- LAQA: only VASP, QE, or soiap for now

## Note: Results and random numbers
- The random seed is changed so the results will not match those in the data. Therefore, even if the environment is almost the same and the user is the same, the results will be different.

## Calculated phase diagram
- The "end_point" is a parameter that specifies the search range of the chemical potential. The standard is to obtain the DFT energy of a single molecule from databases such as Material Projects, literature, or your own calculations, and expand it by about +/- 1 eV.
- The element_structure file in the example is not actually necessary for EA-vc. It is output for reference. Therefore, the make_input_*.py shown below can be made simpler. Since simpler is often better, users may wish to simplify it themselves.
- The general rule for state diagrams is to arrange them in alphabetical order. General names may not always be arranged in alphabetical order. Just be aware of the general rule.
- Temperature control is performed using molecular dynamics (MD). The effects of lattice vibrations (phonons) are taken into account, but the calculation takes time.
- For pressure application at 0 K, it is also a good idea to use QE or the old DFTB+. It is also a good method to find candidates from there and examine them in more detail using MD etc.

## How to use "plot3d.py", "plot3dn.py" or "pplot_v1.py"
- It is designed to correspond to a four-element system. The figure can be obtained by the following command.
```
python3 plot3d.py
```
```
python3 plot3dn.py
```
- The number of atoms of one element in the quaternary system is fixed (nat is fixed to a certain value) and the calculation is performed as a pseudo-ternary system, and the results are shown in the figures. The name "v1" is used because the guide lines have not yet been drawn properly. ("PTD" is an abbreviation for pseudo-ternary diagram.)
```
python3 pplot_v1.py
```

## Automatic generation of input files (EA-vc + CHGNet version)
- Since creating an input file manually can be cumbersome, a Python script called make_input.py is provided for CHGNet (see ase_chgnet_auto_EA-vc).
```
python3 make_input.py Al C Ni Fe
```
- Specify the elements after make_input.py. You can also create ternary or quinary systems.
- The file element_data_chgnet.txt is critical because it is used by ASE to generate POSCAR files.
- This file contains reference structures and lattice constants, which may include simplified or metastable phases for convenience (e.g., Boron as a diamond structure).
- These values are intended for efficient initial structure generation and may differ from actual ground-state phases.
- For accurate results, it is strongly recommended to re-optimize the final structures and energies using DFT or other first-principles methods.
- If necessary, you can edit element_data_chgnet.txt to replace entries with known stable phases or literature values.
- If the generated results appear incorrect, check and adjust this file accordingly.
- If you want to use B_aB12, just change B_dia to a directory named B_aB12, change POSCAR to correspond to the structure of aB12, and change the end_point in cryspy to the eV/atom of aB12. These can be done after "make_input.py". 

## Automatic generation of input files (EA-vc + DFTB+(GFN1-xTB) version)
- The "element_data_dftb.txt" has not been rewritten with the GFN1-xTB results in DFTB+ (I plan to fix this in the future if I have time). Therefore, an element_structure file will be created, so please calculate it and correct the end_point.

## Automatic generation of input files (EA-vc + QE version)
- The "element_data_qe.txt" does not reflect the results of QE (we plan to fix this in the future if we have time). Therefore, the element_structure file will be created, so please perform the calculation and correct the end_point (element_structure may also not be created correctly, so please check).

## Automatic generation of input files (EA-vc + Lammps version)
- The Lammps results are not reflected in "element_data_lammps.txt" (we plan to fix this in the future if we have time). Therefore, the element_structure file will be created, so please run the calculation and correct the end_point (the element_structure may not have been created correctly, so please check).

## How to use "repeat_cryspy.sh"
- "repeat_cryspy.sh" can be used anywhere. You can copy it and use it instead of cryspy as follows.
```
chmod +x repeat_cryspy.sh
bash repeat_cryspy.sh
```

## DFTB+ Installation
- Older versions of DFTB+ allow you to use Pressure with LBFGS, so in some cases you may want to consider using an older version. 
```
### DFTB+ ver. 24.1
cd $HOME
wget https://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus/releases/download/24.1/dftbplus-24.1.x86_64-linux.tar.xz
tar -xvf dftbplus-24.1.x86_64-linux.tar.xz
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dftbplus-24.1.x86_64-linux/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

## Recalculation methods for low-cost calculations like Lammps (or CHGNet) and high-cost calculations like QE (VASP, DFTB+(xTB)).
- After performing the calculation using the low-cost method, copy "data/pkl_data/init_struct_data.pkl" and "data/pkl_data/opt_struc_data.pkl".
- Use the load_struc_flag = True option.
- The [option] load_struc_flag = True setting is only loaded the first time the program is run, so you don't need to worry about it from the second time onwards.

## The "kppvol" and actual k-points
- The "kppvol" is k-points/volume [A^-3].
- The actual k-points to be set can be determined using "kpt_check.py".
- A kppovl value of 40 is appropriate for rough calculations, while a value of 80 is appropriate for full calculations, so no special changes are necessary.

## Phase diagrams attracting attention
- Phase diagrams for precious metals, rare earths, and other elements that are difficult to obtain through experiments should ideally be compiled at each calculation level through cooperation between countries.
- The general rule for state diagrams is to arrange them in alphabetical order. General names may not always be arranged in alphabetical order. Just be aware of the general rule.
- Phase diagrams are being collected by NIMS, but not all the information is available. It would be great if they could be compiled using Phase0 or similar.
